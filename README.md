Inspired by cs76 spring 2012 npuzzle project

This source is my interpretation of the nPuzzle project from the open course from Harvard, cs76. 
The project veers away from some of the requirements in the original statement of work in a few cases,
however, this was developed for fun and not for the course and I wanted to explore a few options.
